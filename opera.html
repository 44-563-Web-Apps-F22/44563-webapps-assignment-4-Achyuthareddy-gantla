    <h5>The Gondoliers</h4>
        <h6>ACT I 
            The Piazzetta, Venice</h4>
        <p style="color:green" >ACT I Scene.— the Piazzetta, Venice. The Ducal Palace on the right.

            Fiametta, Giulia, Vittoria, and other Contadine discovered, each
            tying a bouquet of roses.</p>
            <br>
        <p style="color:red">(During this chorus Antonio, Francesco, Giorgio, and other
            Gondoliers have entered unobserved by the Girls—at first two,
            then two more, then four, then half a dozen, then the remainder
            of the Chorus.)</p>
            <br>
        <p>FRANC.<br> Good morrow, pretty maids; for whom prepare ye
            These floral tributes extraordinary?
             <br>
            FIA.<br> For Marco and Giuseppe Palmieri,
            The pink and flower of all the Gondolieri.
            <br>
            GIU.<br> They're coming here, as we have heard but lately,
            To choose two brides from us who sit sedately.
            <br>
            ANT.<br> Do all you maidens love them?
            <br>
            ALL.<br> Passionately!
            <br>
            ANT.<br>These gondoliers are to be envied greatly!
            <br>
            GIOR.<br> But what of us, who one and all adore you?
            Have pity on our passion, we implore you!
            <br>
            FIA.<br> These gentlemen must make their choice before you;
            <br>
            VIT.<br> In the meantime we tacitly ignore you.
            <br>
            GIU.<br> When they have chosen two that leaves you plenty—
            Two dozen we, and ye are four-and-twenty.
            <br>
            FIA. and VIT. Till then, enjoy your dolce far niente.

            ANT.<br> With pleasure, nobody contradicente!
