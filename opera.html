            <p>(During this chorus Antonio, Francesco, Giorgio, and other
                Gondoliers have entered unobserved by the Girls—at first two,

            <h6>FIA.</h6>For Marco and Giuseppe Palmieri,
            The pink and flower of all the Gondolieri.</p>

            <h6>GIU.</h6>They're coming here, as we have heard but lately,
            To choose two brides from us who sit sedately.</p>
            <p>
            <h6>ANT.</h6>Do all you maidens love them?</p>

            <p>

            <p>
            <h6>FIA</h6>These gentlemen must make their choice before you;</p>
            <p>
            <h6>VIT</h6>In the meantime we tacitly ignore you.</p>
            <p>
            <h6>GIU</h6>When they have chosen two that leaves you plenty—
            Two dozen we, and ye are four-and-twenty.</p>

            </p>
