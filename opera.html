        <p style="color:red">(During this chorus Antonio, Francesco, Giorgio, and other
            Gondoliers have entered unobserved by the Girls—at first two,

            of the Chorus.)</p>
            
        <p>FRA. Good morrow, pretty maids; for whom prepare ye
            These floral tributes extraordinary?</p>
            <p>FIA. For Marco and Giuseppe Palmieri,
            The pink and flower of all the Gondolieri.</p>
            <p>GIU. They're coming here, as we have heard but lately,
            To choose two brides from us who sit sedately.</p>
            <p>ANT. Do all you maidens love them?</p>
            
            ALL. Passionately!
            <p>ANT.These gondoliers are to be envied greatly!</p>
            <p>GIO.But what of us, who one and all adore you?
            Have pity on our passion, we implore you!</p>
            <p>FIA.These gentlemen must make their choice before you;</p>
            <p>VIT.In the meantime we tacitly ignore you.</p>
            <p>GIU. When they have chosen two that leaves you plenty—
            Two dozen we, and ye are four-and-twenty.</p>
            <p>FIA. and VIT. Till then, enjoy your dolce far niente.

            ANT. With pleasure, nobody contradicente!</p>
