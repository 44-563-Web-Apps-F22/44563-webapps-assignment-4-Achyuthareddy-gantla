    <h3>The Gondoliers</h4>
        <h4>ACT I 
            The Piazzetta, Venice</h4>
        <p style="color:green" > Scene.— the Piazzetta, Venice. The Ducal Palace on the right.

            Fiametta, Giulia, Vittoria, and other Contadine discovered, each
            tying a bouquet of roses.</p>
        <p style="color:red">(During this chorus Antonio, Francesco, Giorgio, and other
            Gondoliers have entered unobserved by the Girls—at first two,
            then two more, then four, then half a dozen, then the remainder
            of the Chorus.)</p>
        <p>FRANC. Good morrow, pretty maids; for whom prepare ye
            These floral tributes extraordinary?

            FIA. For Marco and Giuseppe Palmieri,
            The pink and flower of all the Gondolieri.

            GIU. They're coming here, as we have heard but lately,
            To choose two brides from us who sit sedately.

            ANT. Do all you maidens love them?

            ALL. Passionately!

            ANT. These gondoliers are to be envied greatly!

            GIOR. But what of us, who one and all adore you?
            Have pity on our passion, we implore you!

            FIA. These gentlemen must make their choice before you;

            VIT. In the meantime we tacitly ignore you.

            GIU. When they have chosen two that leaves you plenty—
            Two dozen we, and ye are four-and-twenty.

            FIA. and VIT. Till then, enjoy your dolce far niente.

            ANT. With pleasure, nobody contradicente!
